= More information and Pro version =

Visit <https://www.wplab.com/plugins/wp-lister/> to read more about WP-Lister including documentation, installation instructions and user reviews.

To find out more about the different versions have a look on our [feature comparison table](https://www.wplab.com/plugins/wp-lister/feature-comparison/).

== Installation ==

1. Install WP-Lister for eBay either via the WordPress.org plugin repository, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. After activating the plugin, visit the new "eBay" page and follow the setup instructions. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WP-Lister work with all eBay sites? =

Yes, it does.

= What are the requirements to run WP-Lister? =

WP-Lister requires a recent version of WordPress (4.2+) with WooCommerce (2.2+) installed. Your server should run on Linux and have PHP 5.3 or better with cURL support.

Please check out the [list of incompatible hosting providers](https://docs.wplab.com/article/8-wp-lister-for-ebay-requirements) as well. If your provider is on that list, we will not be able to provide any kind of support.

= I use products variations on my site but eBay doesn’t allow variations in the selected category. How can I find out in which categories variations are allowed? =

To learn more about variations and allowed categories you should visit this page: <http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/listing-variations.html>. There you will find a link to eBay’s look up table for categories allowing variations. If you can only list to categories where no variations are allowed, consider purchasing WP-Lister Pro which can split variations into single listings.

= I already have listed my products on eBay. Can WP-Lister import them to WooCommerce? =

No, WP-Lister itself was created to let you manage your products in WordPress - and list them *from* WordPress *to* eBay. 

But if you need to import all your items from eBay to WooCommerce first to be able to use WP-Lister, you can use the [importer add-on plugin](https://www.wplab.com/plugins/import-from-ebay-to-woocommerce/) we developed to get you started. Since importing from eBay is rather complex and support intensive this add-on plugin does have a price tag attached. 

= Does WP-Lister support windows servers? =

No, and there are no plans on adding support for IIS.

= Are there any more FAQ? =

Yes, there are! Please check out our growing knowledgebase at <https://www.wplab.com/plugins/wp-lister/faq/>.

= Is there a WP-Lister for Amazon? =

Yes, there is. WP-Lister for Amazon is currently in beta and we still have to work on the documentation, but you are welcome to give it a try: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-lister-for-amazon/>
